# facebook-hackathon

Getting ready for a Hackathon at Facebook Offices in Madrid!!

## How to install and develop locally?

1. Clone this repo locally: `$ git clone https://github.com/ferreiro/facebook-hackathon.git`
2. Go to the project folder and run `yarn install`
3. yarn dev => This will create two servers, one of the backend server and the other one a dev server for the react application.

### Hot reload

In development, all your frontend assets and app will be automatically rebuild! Also, it will automatically reload the browser! Yay.

*Note* If you do changes to the backend, you will need to manually refresh the website. Sorry guys, didn't have time to do this (and it's really late now)! haha.
